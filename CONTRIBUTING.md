## 📖 What You'll Learn

1. **Types of contributions** - What can be changed
2. **How to prepare your change** - Gathering details
3. **How to find what to edit** - Locating files
4. **Making the edit** - Step-by-step walkthrough
5. **Creating a pull request** - Getting your change reviewed
6. **What happens next** - The publishing process

**Time needed:** 5-20 minutes depending on complexity

### 🚀 Quick Option: Interactive Tools

For **adding resources**, we have an automated Python script:

```bash
python3 tools/submit_resource.py
```

This handles validation, HTML generation, git operations, and PR creation automatically.
**[See documentation →](tools/SUBMIT_RESOURCE_README.md)**

For **adding news sources**, use:

```bash
python3 tools/submit_news_source.py
```

This validates the feed URL, updates `update_news.py`, and prepares a PR.
**[See documentation →](tools/SUBMIT_NEWS_SOURCE_README.md)**

### 🧰 Common Errors and Fixes

- **`python3` not found**: Install Python from python.org and reopen your terminal
- **`git` not found**: Install Git from git-scm.com
- **Not in a git repo**: Run `cd csoh.org` before the script
- **Working directory not clean**: Commit or stash changes, then retry
- **URL flagged as unsafe**: Use the official RSS/Atom feed URL

## 🔧 How to Make Your Contribution

### Adding News Sources

News articles come from RSS feeds. Adding a new source means adding its feed to our script.

#### Step 1: Find the News Script

1. Go to [update_news.py](update_news.py) on GitHub
2. Click the pencil ✏️ icon to edit

#### Step 2: Add Your Feed

Look for this section:

```python
FEEDS = [
   {"name": "AWS Security Blog", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/feed/"},
   {"name": "BleepingComputer", "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/"},
    # ... more feeds
]
```

Add your new feed to the list:

```python
FEEDS = [
   {"name": "AWS Security Blog", "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/feed/"},
   {"name": "BleepingComputer", "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/"},
   {"name": "Your Source Name", "url": "https://your-source.com/feed.xml"},  # ← Add here
]
```

#### Step 3: Commit and Create a Pull Request

1. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
2. Write a message: `"Add [Source Name] to news feeds"`
3. Create a pull request (see [Creating a Pull Request](#creating-a-pull-request) below)

**Tips:**
- Many websites have **RSS feeds** (look for an RSS icon 🔘)
- If the site doesn't list a feed URL, try `/feed`, `/feed.xml`, or `/rss`
- Check the feed actually contains cloud security articles before suggesting
- Add feeds from **reputable sources** (established news sites, vendor blogs, research orgs)

**How to find RSS feeds:**
- Look for an RSS icon on the website
- Try common URLs: `yoursite.com/feed` or `yoursite.com/feed.xml`
- Use a [Feed Finder tool](https://www.feedly.com/) to discover feeds

---

### Editing Content & Descriptions

Whether you're fixing a typo or rewriting a section, the process is the same.

#### Step 1: Find the File to Edit

**For resource descriptions:**
- File: [resources.html](resources.html)

**For homepage content:**
- File: [index.html](index.html)

**For news page:**
- File: [news.html](news.html)

**For other pages:**
- [sessions.html](sessions.html) - Zoom sessions info
- [presentations.html](presentations.html) - Past presentations

#### Step 2: Open the File for Editing

1. Click on the file name above
2. Click the pencil ✏️ icon to edit

#### Step 3: Find What You're Changing

Use `Ctrl+F` (or `Cmd+F` on Mac) to search for the text you're changing.

For example, if you're fixing a resource description:
- Search for the resource name
- Find the `<p>` tag with the description
- Click after the text to position your cursor

#### Step 4: Make Your Edit

Just type! You're editing text, it works like a document:
- **Fix typos:** Select the wrong word, delete it, type the right one
- **Improve descriptions:** Select the old text, replace with better wording
- **Update info:** Change dates, numbers, or outdated content
- **Add links:** Add `<a href="url">text</a>` around text you want to link

**Example - Fixing a typo:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<p>Learn cloud security with hands-on laps.</p>

<!-- AFTER -->
<p>Learn cloud security with hands-on labs.</p>
```

**Example - Improving a description:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<p>AWS training tool.</p>

<!-- AFTER -->
<p>Comprehensive AWS security training with hands-on labs for IAM, 
networking, and data protection.</p>
```

#### Step 5: Commit and Create a Pull Request

1. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
2. Write a helpful message explaining what you changed
3. Create a pull request (see below)

---

### Suggesting Reorganization

Want to suggest moving a resource, adding new tags, or reorganizing sections?

#### Option A: Edit the File Directly

If it's a simple change (moving a resource, fixing a tag):

1. Open [resources.html](resources.html)
2. Find the resource card
3. Change the `<span class="tag">` lines to add/remove/fix tags
4. Move the entire `<a class="card-link">...</a>` block to a different section if needed
5. Commit with a message like: "Move [Resource] to correct category and fix tags"

#### Option B: Suggest It in a Pull Request

If you're not sure exactly how to do it:

1. Fork the repo (see [Creating a Pull Request](#creating-a-pull-request))
2. Make the changes as described above
3. In your pull request description, explain your reasoning:

```
**Suggestion:** Move Redis Labs to "Security Tools" instead of "Labs"
**Reason:** Redis Labs is a vendor tool, not a training lab
**Benefit:** Better organization helps users find what they're looking for
```

### Editing the Homepage

The homepage is at [index.html](index.html). It contains:

2. Click pencil ✏️ to edit
3. Use `Ctrl+F` to find what you want to change
4. Edit the text or HTML
5. Commit and create pull request

   **What's broken:**
   The link to CloudGoat doesn't work
   
   **Where it is:**
   Resources page, CTF section
   
   **What should happen:**
   The link should go to https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat

   **How it could work:**
   New "Interview Prep & Career" section on resources page with 20-30 resources
   ```
