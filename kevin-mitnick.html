            <div class="memorial-content">
                <p>Kevin Mitnick was a very dear friend of mine, even though I played a part in putting him in federal
                    prison for five years. I also helped get him out. It's a long story.</p>

                <p>He passed away in July of 2023, and I have a ton of stories to tell about him.</p>

                <img src="img/IMG_0228_1.jpeg" alt="Kevin Mitnick" class="memorial-image">

                <p>Back in the 80s, Kevin was trying very hard to hack into Novell's network. I was a network
                    administrator. Of course, we had no idea it was Kevin, but things were happening that made it fairly
                    obvious we had a persistent threat. Phones ringing sequentially throughout the building (war
                    dialing) and all sorts of other signs... we knew something was up.</p>

                <p>Late one night at home, I got a phone call from a Novell employee named Gabe Nault. The "employee"
                    wanted direct inbound dial access. Since I was responsible for the entire network's inbound
                    connectivity, I knew this type of request was abnormal and against policy. I had a secure dial-back
                    system for modems where you couldn't make a connection unless you were calling from a known phone
                    number. Not only that, any access required approval by a manager, and this guy had a story about
                    working on a top-secret project called Snowbird (real) and needing to make some emergency code
                    changes, but he was on vacation in Vail at a hotel. He needed the coveted, policy-breaking, direct
                    inbound modem access. Right. He even mentioned his vacation in Vail, which conveniently matched the
                    greeting on Gabe Nault's voicemail. But it all felt wrong.</p>

                <p>With a feeling of suspicion creeping in, I played it cool. I said, "Hey man, I'd love to help you
                    out, but I can't do what you want from here at home anyway, so I'll have to do it in the morning as
                    soon as I get to the office. But in case I forget, please leave me a voicemail." He agreed, and that
                    was that.</p>

                <p>When I got to work, the voicemail was there, and I immediately recorded it onto a cassette recorder
                    for safekeeping. That recording became the primary evidence in Kevin's case. It took some time to
                    actually catch Kevin, though. There's a whole other story about how Tsutomo Shimomura apprehended
                    him in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>

                <p>When he was caught, I found out that my voicemail was the only real evidence, and I would be the
                    primary witness in this high-profile trial. So, I worked very closely with the prosecutors,
                    including Christopher Painter and Ken McGuire, for five years. Eventually, I became fed up with the
                    delays and concerned that Kevin hadn't even been given a chance to argue for bail or access
                    evidence. I questioned the long delays. I said, "There are people who believe you are violating his
                    civil right to due process." The prosecutor's response sent chills down my spine. As a strong
                    believer in the rule of law, I couldn't accept his words. Here was a top prosecutor at the DOJ
                    basically telling me, "They say we are violating his rights, but we are sending a message to other
                    would-be hackers."</p>

                <p><strong>Think about that.</strong></p>

                <p>Our right to due process is the foundation of a just society. This was unacceptable. If this was
                    acceptable, it meant they could put anyone in prison just to intimidate people.</p>

                <p>The conversation turned into a heated debate about my idealistic beliefs, and I ended up parting ways
                    with the DOJ. I immediately tried to contact Kevin's lawyers, but since all they knew was that I was
                    the star witness on the opposing side, they weren't interested in talking. I finally left a
                    convincing voicemail, which resulted in a call with both of his lawyers and Kevin himself the very
                    next day. Keep in mind, up until that phone call, Kevin and I were adversaries. Up until then, I had
                    done everything possible to ensure a conviction.</p>

                <p>Soon after, Kevin was released from prison with a plea deal. While he did bring a lot of this on
                    himself, that doesn't justify the government acting like an oppressive regime.</p>

                <p>A short time later, I got a sincere apology from Kevin. We decided to meet face-to-face. Of all
                    places, it ended up being at RSA in San Francisco, and a reporter named Eleanor Abrue was there. She
                    wrote an article about our meeting, and it went kind of viral. The only thing I disliked about the
                    article was the misleading headline, "Mitnick Meets His Pigeon." If you know anything about the
                    case, that's the exact opposite of what happened.</p>

                <p>The truth is, I was the only person in the entire case who managed to trick him into leaving a
                    crucial piece of evidence: the voice print from the voicemail. It ended up being the only direct
                    evidence linking the 'crimes' to Kevin. Everything else was circumstantial. You can't cross-examine
                    a keystroke.</p>

                <p>Anyway, we hit it off when we met. Somehow, we became great friends in the process, and I have had a
                    wonderful time watching him develop into a real man. I am truly sad he is gone as he was a big part
                    of my life for the last quarter century.</p>

                <p>I have to say, I loved this man like a brother and I will miss him more than I can say. I have
                    promised to make sure his soon-to-be-born son is trained in the ways of the Jedi, Amateur Radio, and
                    maybe a bit about staying out of prison. RIP Kev.</p>

                <h2>When We Met at RSA</h2>
                <p>Here is the story published in Wired about when Kevin and I met face-to-face for the first time.
                    There's some significant factual errors in there, but that's the news for you. It was the beginning
                    of a great friendship. Kevin came to see me present on his favorite topic, Social Engineering.
                    Afterwards, he said he liked my slide deck so much that he wanted permission to use parts of it. To
                    be honest, I didn't even think twice before I said yes. Kevin went on to be a captivating and
                    sought-after speaker.</p>

                <p>Many years later, we were at RSA again, and I insisted on taking Kevin and his wonderful wife
                    Kimberley to Alcatraz. He was such a great sport about it.</p>
