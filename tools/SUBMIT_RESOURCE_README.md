## Features

### 🔒 Automatic URL Safety Validation

Every URL is checked against:
- **Suspicious patterns** - Phishing indicators, URL shorteners, malware signatures
- **Security best practices** - HTTPS usage, domain legitimacy
- **Blocklists** - Known malicious domains
- **Whitelists** - Trusted sources (GitHub, AWS, Microsoft, etc.)

If a URL fails validation:
- ❌ **Errors** - Blocks submission (unsafe URL detected)
- ⚠️ **Warnings** - Prompts for confirmation (suspicious but not blocked)

### 📋 Smart Category Selection

Choose from 6 main categories:
1. CTF Challenges & Vulnerable Environments
2. Hands-On Labs & Training Platforms
3. Security Tools & Platforms
4. Certifications & Professional Development
5. AI Security Resources
6. Job Search Resources

The script automatically inserts your resource in the correct HTML section.

### 🏷️ Comprehensive Tag System

Select from 20+ tags organized by:
- **Platform Tags** - AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Multi-Cloud
- **Resource Type** - CTF, Labs, Tools, Certifications, Job Search
- **Security Focus** - Penetration Testing, DevSecOps, IAM, Compliance, AI Security
- **Other** - NEW 2025, Free, Paid, Open Source

### 🌿 Git Integration

Automatically:
- Checks for clean working directory
- Creates descriptive branch names (e.g., `add-cloudgoat`)
- Commits with clear messages
- Optionally pushes to remote
- Provides PR creation link

## Error Handling

### Git Repository Issues
```
❌ Not in a git repository
❌ Working directory has uncommitted changes
```
**Solution:** Navigate to the repo root and commit/stash changes first.

### URL Validation Failures
```
❌ URL validation failed:
   • Domain 'malicious-site.com' is on blocklist
```
**Solution:** Use a different, legitimate URL.

### Category Section Not Found
```
❌ Could not find section for category: CTF Challenges
```
**Solution:** The HTML structure may have changed. Add the resource manually or report the issue.

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a CTF Challenge
```bash
$ python3 tools/submit_resource.py

Resource name: OWASP EKS Goat
URL: https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-eks-goat
Description: Intentionally vulnerable AWS EKS environment with 20+ 
             attack-defense labs for Kubernetes security training.
Category: 1 (CTF Challenges)
Tags: 1,4,6,7 (AWS, Kubernetes, CTF, Labs & Training)

✅ Created branch: add-owasp-eks-goat
✅ Committed changes
🚀 Pushed to GitHub
```

### Example 2: Adding a Security Tool
```bash
$ python3 tools/submit_resource.py

Resource name: Prowler
URL: https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler

             with CIS benchmarks and compliance frameworks.
