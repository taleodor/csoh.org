## 🛠️ Managing Content

### Adding a New Resource

1. **Open `resources.html`** in your editor
2. **Locate the appropriate section** (CTF, Labs, Tools, etc.)
3. **Add a new resource card** before the closing `</div>` of the section:

```html
<a href="https://resource-url.com" target="_blank" class="card-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <div class="resource-card">
        <img src="img/previews/resource-url.com.jpg" alt="Preview" class="resource-preview">
        <h3>Resource Name</h3>
        <p>Brief description of what this resource offers and why it's valuable for cloud security professionals.</p>
        <div class="resource-tags">
            <span class="tag">AWS</span>
            <span class="tag">Security</span>
            <span class="tag new">NEW</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</a>
```

4. **Commit and push** to update the live site

### Adding a New Article to News

News articles are **updated automatically** — you don't need to add them by hand. A GitHub Actions workflow runs every 12 hours, pulls articles from 22 cloud security RSS feeds, and creates a pull request with the new content. See the [How Automation Works](#-how-automation-works) section below for details, or read the full docs in [UPDATE_NEWS_README.md](UPDATE_NEWS_README.md).

To **add a new news source**, edit the `FEEDS` list at the top of `update_news.py` and submit a pull request.

### Adding a New Zoom Session or Presentation

1. **For Sessions:** Edit `sessions.html` to add session details

2. **For Presentations:** Edit `presentations.html` and add a new card with:
   - Date and title
   - Speaker name
   - Description
   - Topic tags
   - Video/presentation link

### Customizing the Homepage

Edit the "Resource Categories" section in `index.html` to:
- Change category descriptions
- Modify call-to-action buttons
- Adjust hero section messaging

## 🤖 How Automation Works

This site uses three **GitHub Actions workflows** that handle routine tasks automatically. GitHub Actions is a free automation service built into GitHub — think of it as a robot that runs scripts for you whenever certain things happen in the repo.

### 1. News Auto-Updates (every 12 hours)

**What it does:** Keeps the [News page](https://csoh.org/news.html) fresh without anyone manually adding articles.

**How it works:** Twice a day, a Python script (`update_news.py`) checks 22 cloud security news sources for new articles. It filters for relevant topics, removes duplicates, and updates `news.html`. The workflow creates a Pull Request with the changes — if only `news.html` changed, it auto-merges. Once merged, the site is automatically deployed.

**Full docs:** [UPDATE_NEWS_README.md](UPDATE_NEWS_README.md)

### 2. SRI Hash & Cache-Bust Updates (on CSS/JS changes)

**What it does:** Keeps the site secure and prevents visitors from seeing stale styles after updates.

**How it works:** Whenever `style.css` or `main.js` is changed and pushed to `main`, a Python script (`update_sri.py`) automatically:
- Recalculates **SRI fingerprints** — cryptographic hashes that let the browser verify the file hasn't been tampered with
- Updates **cache-busting version tags** (`?v=abc123` in the URL) — so browsers download the fresh file instead of serving an old cached copy
- Commits the updated HTML files and pushes them

**Full docs:** [UPDATE_SRI_README.md](UPDATE_SRI_README.md)

### 3. Auto-Deploy to Web Server (on push to main)

**What it does:** Uploads the latest site files to the web server whenever changes land on the `main` branch.

**How it works:** After any push to `main` (including auto-merged news PRs and SRI hash commits), the deploy workflow checks out the code, recalculates SRI hashes as a safety net, and uploads everything to the web server via FTP.

### Setup Note

All three workflows use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** stored as a GitHub repo secret called `PAT_TOKEN` (because the GitHub organization restricts the default token). If workflows start failing with permission errors, the PAT may need to be rotated — see the setup instructions in [UPDATE_NEWS_README.md](UPDATE_NEWS_README.md#setup-requirements).
