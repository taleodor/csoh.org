# SRI Hash & Cache-Busting Automation

## What Is SRI and Why Do We Use It?

**SRI (Subresource Integrity)** is a browser security feature that protects your website's visitors. Here's the idea in plain English:

Every time someone visits csoh.org, their browser downloads files like `style.css` (which controls how the site looks) and `main.js` (which powers search and filtering). SRI adds a **fingerprint** (a cryptographic hash) to each of those files. When the browser downloads the file, it checks: "Does this file's fingerprint match what the HTML page says it should be?" If it doesn't match — maybe the file was tampered with or corrupted — the browser **refuses to use it**. This protects visitors from loading malicious code.

In our HTML, it looks like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css?v=892ae8aa"
  integrity="sha384-UmMu+V7pIRzpjQe5g9nD/fa/7i08YXu8TIfTeY4HaXp3ZnbIZHlsFmMRkblktE/G">
```

- `integrity="sha384-..."` is the fingerprint
- `?v=892ae8aa` is a **cache-busting** parameter (explained below)

---

## What Is Cache-Busting?

Browsers **cache** (save a local copy of) CSS and JS files to make pages load faster on repeat visits. The problem: if we update `style.css`, returning visitors might still see the old cached version for days or even months.

**Cache-busting** solves this by adding a version tag to the file URL: `/style.css?v=892ae8aa`. The `?v=` value is based on the file's content — so when the file changes, the version tag changes, and the browser treats it as a brand new file and downloads the fresh version.

---

## How It Works Automatically

Whenever someone changes `style.css` or `main.js` and pushes to the `main` branch, a **GitHub Actions workflow** automatically:

1. Calculates a new SHA-384 fingerprint for each file
2. Generates a new cache-busting version tag from the file content
3. Updates every HTML file with the new fingerprint and version tag
4. Commits and pushes the updated HTML files
5. The Deploy workflow then uploads everything to the web server

```
You push a change to style.css or main.js
        |
        v
  GitHub Actions runs update_sri.py
        |
        v
  Script calculates new fingerprint + version tag
        |
        v
  All HTML files are updated automatically
        |
        v
  Changes committed and pushed to main
        |
        v
  Deploy workflow uploads to web server
```

You never have to manually update fingerprints or worry about visitors seeing stale CSS/JS.

## The Script: `update_sri.py`

This Python script does all the work. Note that `style.css` includes a large dark mode section (~500 lines of overrides), so any changes to dark mode styling will trigger SRI hash recalculation. When run, the script:

1. Reads `style.css` and `main.js` from the repo
2. Calculates a **SHA-384 hash** (the fingerprint) for each file
3. Calculates a **short SHA-256 hash** (the cache-bust `?v=` tag) for each file
4. Scans every `.html` file in the repo
5. Updates the `integrity` attribute with the new fingerprint
6. Updates the `href`/`src` URL with the new `?v=` tag
7. Removes any `crossorigin` attribute (not needed for same-origin files — having it caused mobile browsers to block the CSS)

### Running manually

```bash
python3 update_sri.py
```

Example output:

```
Calculating SRI hashes...
  style.css: sha384-UmMu+V7pI... (v=892ae8aa)
  main.js: sha384-VaUAqRVQ5... (v=f5430db3)

Updating 12 HTML files...
  - Unchanged: 403.html
  - Unchanged: 404.html
  ...
Done! Modified 0 of 12 files.
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x (standard library only — no `pip install` needed)

---

## The Workflow: `.github/workflows/update-sri.yml`

### Triggers

- **On push to main:** Runs automatically when `style.css`, `main.js`, or `update_sri.py` are changed
- **Manual:** You can trigger it anytime from the GitHub Actions tab

### What it does

1. Checks out the latest code
2. Runs `python3 update_sri.py`
3. If any HTML files changed, commits and pushes them
4. The Deploy workflow detects the new commit and uploads the site

---

## Manual Hash Calculation

If you just want to check a file's hash without running the full script, there's also a shell script:

```bash
./calculate-sri.sh main.js style.css
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| CSS not loading on mobile | SRI fingerprint doesn't match the file content | Run `python3 update_sri.py` and deploy |
| CSS not loading despite correct hash | `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute present | Remove `crossorigin` from the HTML tags — the script does this automatically |
| Visitors seeing old styles after a CSS update | Browser cache serving the old file | The `?v=` cache-busting parameter should prevent this — run `update_sri.py` to regenerate |
| Workflow can't push commits | Missing or expired PAT | Create a new fine-grained PAT with Contents permissions and save it as the `PAT_TOKEN` repo secret |

---

## Setup Requirements

The workflow uses a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** stored as a GitHub repo secret called `PAT_TOKEN`. This is needed because the GitHub organization restricts what the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can do.

To set up or rotate the token:

1. Go to [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a **fine-grained token**
2. Grant it access to the `CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org` repository
3. Give it **Contents** (read/write) and **Pull requests** (read/write) permissions
4. Go to the repo's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and save it as `PAT_TOKEN`
