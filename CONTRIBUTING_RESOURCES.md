## 🎯 What This Guide Covers

1. **Understanding what you're doing** - We'll explain the basics
2. **Finding and preparing your resource** - What info you need to gather
3. **Adding it to the website** - Step-by-step instructions
4. **Creating a pull request** - How to share your contribution with the community
5. **Getting your resource published** - What happens next

**Time needed:** ~10-15 minutes for your first contribution

### 🚀 Quick Option: Interactive Submission Tool

We have an **automated Python script** that handles everything for you:

```bash
python3 tools/submit_resource.py
```

This interactive tool:
- ✅ Prompts you for all required information
- ✅ Validates URLs automatically
- ✅ Generates proper HTML
- ✅ Creates git branch and commits
- ✅ Provides PR creation instructions

### 🧭 Beginner Walkthrough (Interactive Tool)

If you are new to GitHub or the command line, this is the easiest path. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python** (if you do not already have it)
  - Mac: Python 3 is usually installed. If not, install from python.org.
  - Windows: Install from python.org and check the box "Add to PATH".

2. **Open a terminal**
  - Mac: Spotlight → Terminal
  - Windows: Start → Command Prompt or PowerShell

3. **Clone the repository** (one time only)
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org.git
  cd csoh.org
  ```

4. **Run the script**
  ```bash
  python3 tools/submit_resource.py
  ```

5. **Answer the prompts**
  - Resource name
  - URL
  - Description
  - Category
  - Tags
  - Confirmation

6. **When it finishes**, it will tell you exactly how to push and open a PR

### 🔒 URL Safety and Preview Images

The script checks URL safety and can optionally generate a preview image for you.
If you skip the preview, a GitHub Actions workflow will capture a screenshot after you open a PR.

### 🧰 Common Errors and Fixes

- **`python3` not found**
  - Install Python from python.org and reopen your terminal.
  - On Windows, make sure "Add to PATH" is checked.

- **`git` not found**
  - Install Git from git-scm.com and reopen your terminal.

- **Not in a git repo**
  - Run `cd csoh.org` before running the script.

- **Working directory has uncommitted changes**
  - Commit or stash changes, then re-run the script.

- **Permission denied**
  - Run `chmod +x tools/submit_resource.py` or use `python3 tools/submit_resource.py`.

- **URL flagged as unsafe**
  - Use the official site or GitHub repo URL and try again.

### 🧪 Copy/Paste Commands

**Mac or Linux (Terminal):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org.git
cd csoh.org
python3 tools/submit_resource.py
```

## 📖 What is a Resource?

A **resource** is anything that helps cloud security professionals learn, practice, or advance their careers. Examples:

- 🎯 **CTF Challenges** - Intentionally broken cloud setups you practice hacking
- 🛠️ **Security Tools** - Software that scans or protects cloud infrastructure
- 🎓 **Certifications** - Official courses that teach cloud security skills
- 🧪 **Hands-On Labs** - Interactive exercises where you learn by doing
- 💼 **Job Boards** - Places to find cloud security careers
- 🤖 **AI Security Resources** - Tools and training for AI/ML security

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Add a Resource in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Gather Your Resource Info

Before you do anything technical, write down these details about your resource:

```
Name:           [e.g., "CloudGoat"]
URL:            [e.g., "https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat"]
Description:    [1-2 sentences explaining what it is and why it's useful]
Tags:           [Select from the list below]
Category:       [Pick one main category]
```

**Example:**
```
Name:           OWASP EKS Goat
URL:            https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-eks-goat
Description:    Intentionally vulnerable AWS EKS environment with 20+ attack-defense 
                labs simulating real-world misconfigurations and IAM flaws.
Tags:           CTF, Labs & Training, AWS, Kubernetes
Category:       CTF Challenges
```

### Step 2: Pick Your Tags

Tags help people find resources. Pick 2-5 tags from this list:

**Resource Types:** `CTF` • `Labs & Training` • `Tool` • `Certification` • `Job Search`

**Cloud Platforms:** `AWS` • `Azure` • `GCP` • `Kubernetes` • `Multi-Cloud`

**Security Focus:** `Vulnerability Testing` • `Penetration Testing` • `Cloud Scanning` • `Secrets Management` • `Compliance` • `AI Security` • `IAM` • `DevSecOps`

**Other:** `NEW 2025` • `Free` • `Paid` • `Open Source`

### Step 3: Get a Preview Image (Optional)

Preview images are the small screenshot shown for each resource. They're optional—the site works without them, but they make things look nice.

**Easy option:** Just skip this step! The website will automatically generate thumbnails.

**Better option:** Provide a custom preview image:
- Take a screenshot of the resource's homepage
- Save it as a JPG file (about 150KB or smaller)
- Name it something clear, like: `cloudgoat-preview.jpg`

### Step 4: Edit the Resources HTML File

**Don't be scared!** HTML is just text with special labels. Here's what you need to do:

1. Go to [resources.html](resources.html) on GitHub (or use your code editor)
2. Find the section for your resource's category
3. Copy an **existing resource card** (we'll show you how)
4. Paste it and change the details

**Here's what a resource card looks like:**

```html
<a href="PASTE_YOUR_URL_HERE" class="card-link" target="_blank">
    <div class="resource-card">
        <h3>Your Resource Name</h3>
        <p>Your resource description goes here. Keep it to 1-2 sentences explaining what it does and why it's useful.</p>
        <div class="resource-tags">
            <span class="tag ctf">CTF</span>
            <span class="tag">AWS</span>
            <span class="tag">Kubernetes</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</a>
```

**What to change:**
- `PASTE_YOUR_URL_HERE` → Your resource's URL
- `Your Resource Name` → The actual name
- `Your resource description...` → What you wrote in Step 1
- The `<span class="tag">` lines → Your tags

**Tag styling:** Some tags have special colors:
- `<span class="tag ctf">` = CTF (teal)
- `<span class="tag tool">` = Tool (purple)
- `<span class="tag lab">` = Lab/Training (green)
- `<span class="tag ai-security">` = AI Security (orange)
- `<span class="tag certification">` = Certification (blue)
- `<span class="tag job">` = Job Search (pink)
- `<span class="tag">` = Regular tag (gray)

> **Note:** All tag colors automatically adapt to dark mode — you don't need to add any dark mode–specific styles.

**Don't worry about images yet!** The site will handle that automatically. If you want to add a custom preview image, [see Step 5](#step-5-add-a-preview-image-optional).

### Step 5: Add a Preview Image (Optional)

If you took a screenshot in Step 3, follow these sub-steps:

#### 5a. Upload Your Image

1. Go to the [img/previews/](img/previews/) folder on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag/drop your screenshot
4. Write a commit message: "Add preview image for [Resource Name]"
5. Click "Commit changes"

#### 5b. Edit preview-mapping.json

1. Open [preview-mapping.json](preview-mapping.json)
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Find this section and add a new line:

```json
{
  "https://your-resource-url.com": "img/previews/your-preview-image.jpg",
  "https://another-resource.com": "img/previews/another-preview.jpg"
}
```

For example:
```json
{
  "https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat": "img/previews/cloudgoat-preview.jpg",
  "https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat": "img/previews/kubernetes-goat-preview.jpg"
}
```

3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

## 🍴 Creating a Pull Request (GitHub)

**What's a pull request?** It's how you ask a project to accept your changes. Think of it as raising your hand in class to share something.

### Beginner-Friendly Method: GitHub's Web Interface

You don't need to install anything or learn command-line. Here's the easiest way:

#### Step A: Fork the Repository

1. Go to [github.com/CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org](https://github.com/CloudSecurityOfficeHours/csoh.org)
2. Click the **"Fork"** button (top-right corner)

   ![Fork button location](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-25158/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

3. This creates your own copy of the project

#### Step B: Edit the Files

1. In **your fork**, click on `resources.html`
2. Click the pencil icon ✏️ to edit
3. Find where you want to add your resource (scroll to the right category section)
4. Paste your resource card (see Step 4 above)
5. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
6. Add a message like: "Add [Resource Name] to resources"
7. Click **"Commit changes"** again

**Repeat for `preview-mapping.json`** if you have a custom preview image.

#### Step C: Create the Pull Request

1. Go back to **your fork** homepage
2. You'll see a yellow banner saying **"This branch is ahead of CloudSecurityOfficeHours:main"**
3. Click the **"Contribute"** button → **"Open pull request"**
4. Add a title: "Add [Resource Name]"
5. Add a description:
   ```
   **Resource:** [Name]
   **URL:** [Link]
   **Category:** [Category]
   
   This resource teaches [what it teaches]. It would be great 
   for people learning about [what topic].
   ```
6. Click **"Create pull request"**

**That's it!** The maintainers will review your contribution.

## 🛡️ Automated URL Safety Check

When you submit your pull request, our automated security system will validate all URLs in your contribution. Here's what happens:

### ✅ What Gets Checked

Every URL is automatically scanned for:
- **Suspicious patterns** - URL shorteners, raw IP addresses, phishing indicators
- **Security best practices** - HTTPS usage, domain legitimacy
- **Blocklisted domains** - Known malicious or spam sites
- **Whitelisted domains** - Trusted sources (GitHub, AWS, Microsoft, etc.)

### 🤖 The Validation Process

1. **GitHub Actions workflow runs** - Automatically triggered when any HTML file changes
2. **All 1,000+ site URLs are scanned** - Your new URL plus all existing ones
3. **Results posted as a check** - You'll see ✅ or ❌ in the PR
4. **Report generated** - Full details available as a workflow artifact

### 🚨 If a URL Fails Validation

**Don't worry!** The workflow blocks unsafe URLs but provides clear guidance:

- **⚠️ Suspicious** (warning) - URL might have minor issues but isn't blocked
  - Example: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
  - Example: Very long domain names
  - **Action:** The PR can still merge, but consider updating the URL

- **❌ Unsafe** (blocked) - URL matches malicious patterns or is blocklisted
  - Example: Known phishing domain
  - Example: Executable files in URL
  - **Action:** PR will be blocked. Update the URL or remove it, then re-submit

### 📋 Sample Report

```
Total URLs checked: 1,018
  ✅ Safe:        1,017 (99.9%)
  ⚠️  Suspicious:  1 (0.1%)
  ❌ Unsafe:      0 (0%)

⚠️  SUSPICIOUS URL:
📄 resources.html
   http://example.com/resource
   - Uses HTTP (not HTTPS) - may be insecure
```

### 💡 Pro Tips for URL Safety

- **Always use HTTPS** when available
- **Use official sources** - Link to official documentation or GitHub repos
- **Avoid URL shorteners** - Use the full destination URL
- **Test the link** - Make sure it actually works before submitting

This automated check protects our 2,000+ community members from malicious links while keeping the contribution process smooth and transparent!
